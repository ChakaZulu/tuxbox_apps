dvbsnoop   - an open source DVB/MPEG stream analyzer
====================================================


http://dvbsnoop.sourceforge.net/
http://cvs.tuxbox.org/



dvbsnoop is a DVB/MPEG stream analyzer program.
The program can be used to sniff, monitor, debug, dump
or view DVB/MPEG/DSM-CC/MHP stream information (digital
television or data broadcasts) sent via satellite, cable
or terrestrial.

The program was mainly written to learn and understand the DVB 
protocol structures and streams. dvbsnoop is currently part of
the tuxbox project, bringing Linux based TV software to some
set top boxes (digital satellite/cable receivers).


Documentation and example outputs can be found at:

Basic requirements:
===================

  - a DVB card (not needed for offline decoding of recorded files)
  - Linux DVB API version 1 or 3 installed (see www.linuxtv.org)
 or
  - a Linux based set top box (using DVB API version 1 or 3)
    (e.g. 'dbox2' or 'dreambox')



Installation:
=============
  - install the DVB API driver from http://www.linuxtv.org
    (linux kernel 2.6.x and above are already providing the DVB API)

  - download the latest source from http://dvbsnoop.sourceforge.net
    (download a tarball or checkout from cvs)

  - unzip and untar the archive (if needed)
      gzip -d  dvbsnoop-<version>.tar.gz
      tar xvf  dvbsnoop-<version>.tar
      cd dvbsnoop-<version>

  - configure the source
      ./autogen.sh	# e.g. on "dbox2" cdk, use if needed
      ./configure
    
    or you may specify a path to DVB API include files
      ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/path/to/dvb-kernel/linux/include

  - compile 
      make
      make install

  - test
      dvbsnoop -help

  - PROBLEMS compiling dvbsnoop?
      dvbsnoop should compile smoothly on any ANSI-C-Compiler. But it was
      tested on GCC (gcc-3.x) only.
      If you see any problems during 'autoconf.sh' or 'configure' execution,
      please check if you have the latest versions of 'autoconf' and 'configure'
      installed. In cases, please update your system (check packages 
      automake, autoconf and libtool).



Posting dvbsnoop output:
========================
  If you are posting dvbsnoop output to mailing lists, newsgroups, public boards
  or whatever, please always include the dvbsnoop header:

   e.g.: " dvbsnoop V1.2.49 -- http://dvbsnoop.sourceforge.net/" 

   The version information is helpful if there are discussions about the
   decoding output.



Using source code snippets for your own purpose:
================================================
  You may do so, but you should follow the rules of the GPL.
  Please include a link or reference to dvbsnoop in your program or
  documentation... Thanks.



Bugs, requests:
===============
  Well, if you find some bugs, please let me know.
  (check first, if the data stream is not broken).

  Please do not send binary data stream files or large 
  decoding output via email! (If needed, I will ask for it!)
  But it is a good advise to save the data stream using
  the option "dvbsnoop -s ... -b ... > file" on your harddrive.
  It might be helpful for further investigations.
